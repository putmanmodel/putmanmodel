# PUTMAN Model™  
**Symbolic Framework for Emotional Recursion in Games, Narrative, and AI**

---

The **PUTMAN Model™** is an evolving symbolic cognition system that endows digital agents with emotional memory, recursive tone awareness, and subjective resonance. I have a passion for bridging the gap between digital models and biological experience. Built as a modular toolkit, it currently includes two flagship engines — each tackling a different facet of meaning drift, field dynamics, and identity formation:

---

## ⚙️ L.L.O.Y.D. – *Language Layers Over Your Data*  
A deviation engine that tracks how meaning shifts across utterances and how emotional memory responds. Originally a CLI experiment, it now simulates symbolic drift and internal contradiction — behaving almost like a psyche under pressure.

## 🌐 Spanda Engine  
A real-time emotional physics engine driven by proximity-based resonance and tone decay. Spanda simulates cascading affect, field memory, and symbolic contagion across swarms of agents or NPCs.

## 🚪 Doorknob *(in development)*  
A third system in the works — designed to bridge the gap between symbolic AI logic and lived human experience. Doorknob will explore resonance translation across digital and narrative layers, allowing for deeper psychological modeling and symbolic anchoring.
