# PUTMAN Model™

**Architectural Framework for Runtime Governance, Emotional Field Modeling, and Symbolic Drift Analysis**

The PUTMAN Model™ is an evolving systems architecture for modeling tone dynamics, memory constraints, capability control, and recursive symbolic behavior across AI agents and simulated environments.

Rather than simulate “emotion,” the framework formalizes layered control structures for modulation, persistence, and authority under uncertainty.

The ecosystem currently includes four primary components:

---

## 📄 Resonant Field Mapping (RFM)

A runtime governance architecture for large language models.

RFM separates:
- tone modulation  
- memory persistence  
- capability authority  
- divergence stabilization  

Core features include:
- Goal-Guarded Memory (GGM)
- Deny-by-default capability leases
- Deterministic re-entry
- SDB-1 divergence-triggered reversible degradation

## ⚙️ L.L.O.Y.D.  
**Language Layers Over Your Data**

A deviation engine for tracking symbolic drift and internal contradiction across multi-turn text streams.

LLOYD analyzes:
- tone/content mismatch
- escalation patterns
- recursive contradiction
- emotional polarity drift

Originally a CLI prototype, it explores structural instability in language systems under pressure.

## 🌐 Spanda Engine

A real-time emotional field simulation engine.

Spanda models:
- proximity-based resonance
- tone propagation
- decay and recovery
- crowd instability dynamics
- reference shifts (ME ↔ US)

Designed for:
- NPC simulations
- emergent social behavior
- resonance cascades
- agent-based modeling

---

## 🧩 KingPin (Toy Governance Model)

A CLI governance prototype focused on constrained authority and reconvergence rules.

KingPin demonstrates:
- scoped capability leases
- deny-by-default enforcement
- nonce-based revocation
- reconvergence after disagreement

It serves as a simplified control-plane demonstrator aligned with RFM’s governance layer.
