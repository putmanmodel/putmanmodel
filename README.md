# PUTMAN Model™

**Symbolic Framework for Emotional Recursion in Games, Narrative, and AI**

The PUTMAN Model is a symbolic mapping system that tracks emotional tone across recursive interactions — designed to give digital systems emotional memory, subjective resonance, and symbolic awareness.

This repository begins with the **Resonant Field Mapping™ (RFM™)** module, a non-mimetic empathy layer for use in:
- Narrative games and RPGs
- NPC relationship design
- LLM-based agents
- Emotional tone systems in AI
- Symbolic modeling in therapy and education

## 🧠 Core Components

- **RFM™** – Resonant Field Mapping™: tracks symbolic tone through tokens over time
- **RCC™** – Real Character Connection™: player⇄NPC bond modeling via tone weight
- **TDR™** – Truly Deep Relationships™: emergent symbolic memory structures
- **RIC™** – Real Identity Construction™: evolving identity based on tone interaction
- **REG™** – Real Ecology Gameplay™: dynamic world response based on accumulated tone fields
