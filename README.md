# PUTMAN Model™

**Symbolic Framework for Emotional Recursion in Games, Narrative, and AI**

The PUTMAN Model is a symbolic mapping system that tracks emotional tone across recursive interactions — designed to give digital systems emotional memory, subjective resonance, and symbolic awareness.

This repository begins with the **Resonant Field Mapping™ (RFM™)** module, a non-mimetic empathy layer *(i.e., not based on surface imitation, but internal symbolic response)* for use in:
- Narrative games and RPGs  
- NPC relationship design  
- LLM-based agents  
- Emotional tone systems in AI  
- Symbolic modeling in therapy and education

## 🧠 Core Components

- **RFM™** – Resonant Field Mapping™: tracks symbolic tone through tokens over time  
- **RCC™** – Real Character Connection™: player⇄NPC bond modeling via tone weight  
- **TDR™** – Deep Relationship Structures™: emergent symbolic memory systems  
- **RIC™** – Real Identity Construction™: evolving identity based on tone interaction  
- **REG™** – Real Ecology Gameplay™: dynamic world response based on accumulated tone fields

## 🎭 Emotional Field Simulations

This prototype demonstrates how symbolic tone fields can simulate emotional dynamics with narrative consequence. Each scene models affective tone as a numeric field shaped by time, tension, and resolution.

### 🌿 Trust Decay: *Elder Oak*
**Tone**: Fading rapport  
**Mechanic**: Trust → decreases over time  
**Narrative shift**: If trust falls too low, Elder Oak becomes guarded.

### ⚖️ Fear vs Confidence: *Mira & Thorne*  
**Tone**: Emotional polarity  
**Mechanic**: Fear rises as Confidence tries to stabilize; the stronger field shapes their final decision.  
**Narrative shift**: One leads, one withdraws—or they find balance.

### 🎮 Joy and Love through Play: *Lyra & Cassian*  
**Tone**: Cooperative resonance  
**Mechanic**: Emotional growth via shared wins in play  
**Narrative shift**: Mutual highs produce emotional union—or a subtle divergence.
