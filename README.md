# PUTMAN Model™

**Architectural Framework for Runtime Governance, Emotional Field Modeling, and Symbolic Drift Analysis**

The PUTMAN Model™ is an evolving systems architecture for modeling tone dynamics, memory constraints, capability control, and recursive symbolic behavior across AI agents and simulated environments.

Rather than simulate “emotion,” the framework formalizes layered control structures for modulation, persistence, and authority under uncertainty.

## Ecosystem components
Four primary components:

### 📄 Resonant Field Mapping (RFM)
A governance layer for runtime control of language-model behavior.

RFM separates:
- tone modulation
- memory persistence
- capability authority
- divergence stabilization

Core features include:
- Goal-Guarded Memory (GGM)
- Deny-by-default capability leases
- Deterministic re-entry
- SDB-1 divergence-triggered reversible degradation

### ⚙️ L.L.O.Y.D.
**Language Layers Over Your Data**

A deviation engine for tracking symbolic drift and internal contradiction across multi-turn text streams.

LLOYD analyzes:
- tone/content mismatch
- escalation patterns
- recursive contradiction
- emotional polarity drift

### 🌐 Spanda Engine
A real-time emotional field simulation engine.

Spanda models:
- proximity-based resonance
- tone propagation
- decay and recovery
- crowd instability dynamics
- reference shifts (ME ↔ US)

### 🧩 KingPin (Toy Governance Model)
A CLI governance prototype focused on constrained authority and reconvergence rules.

KingPin demonstrates:
- scoped capability leases
- deny-by-default enforcement
- nonce-based revocation
- reconvergence after disagreement

It serves as a simplified control-plane demonstrator aligned with RFM’s governance layer.
